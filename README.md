## Template Changes

I downloaded the "Creative" template from https://startbootstrap.com/theme/creative for the home page, and used a basic features template for the jobs page from https://startbootstrap.com/template/heroic-features. 

The templates came with base css files, however my own personal css file with my custom styling is "custom.css" inside of the css folder. In this CSS file i alter the base Bootstrap css colors, as well as adjust formatting for the iFrame youtube video. I reference both classes and id's per the homework instructions. Note: id's were added into the pure html of index.html.

I altered the template html to change the navbar links, as well as the text across the entire website. Under the "video" section in index.html (line 179), I inserted an iFrame for a youtube video. Additionally, I hyperlinked the line above (178) per homework requirements. 

All of the images were downloaded from https://pixabay.com/ and can be found in the "assets" folder.

The images html contains alt text to be more accessible, and the bootstrap formatting uses dynamic styling to adjust to mobile and tablet view. 

The site also links to another page under the "Join the team!" heading, which is the fake jobs listings page. This page references the same styling document as index.html.
